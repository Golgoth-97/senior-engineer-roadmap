### 2025-11-23 (Saturday) ✅ - DAY 1 COMPLETE!

**Problems Solved**: 1
- ✅ #1 - Two Sum (Easy) - Arrays & Hashing

**Hash Map Practice**: 1/3 exercises completed
- ✅ Exercise 1: Contains Duplicate (solved correctly on first try!)
- ⏳ Exercise 2: First Non-Repeating Character (planned for tomorrow)
- ⏳ Exercise 3: Group Anagrams (planned for tomorrow)

**Time Spent**: ~2-3 hours total
- Two Sum: 5 minutes (initial attempt)
- Learning hash maps: 1 hour
- Hash map practice: 30 minutes

**What I Learned**:
- **Hash Map Basics**: How to use Map in TypeScript (set, get, has, delete)
- **Hash Map Complement Pattern**: Instead of O(n²) nested loops, use hash map for O(1) lookups
- **Set vs Map**: When to use Set (just existence) vs Map (key-value pairs)
- **Testing is crucial**: Always test with multiple cases, not just the first example
- **Read problems carefully**: "ANY two numbers" vs "adjacent numbers"
- **TypeScript execution**: Use `npx tsx` to run .ts files, not `node`

**Challenges**:
- Two Sum initial solution only checked adjacent elements
- Didn't understand hash maps at first - took time to learn the concept
- Needed help running TypeScript files

**Wins Today**: 🎉
- ✅ Set up entire senior engineer roadmap repository
- ✅ Created comprehensive progress tracking system
- ✅ Solved first LeetCode problem
- ✅ Learned hash maps from scratch
- ✅ Applied hash map pattern successfully (Contains Duplicate)
- ✅ Asked good questions and learned from mistakes
- ✅ Built strong foundation for Day 2

**Key Insights**:
- Making mistakes is part of learning (Two Sum bug taught me a lot)
- Understanding fundamentals (hash maps) is more important than rushing through problems
- The "complement pattern" will be useful for many problems
- Keep this terminal open to maintain context, or update files before closing

**Tomorrow's Plan**:
- [ ] Complete Hash Map Exercise 2 (First Non-Repeating Character)
- [ ] Complete Hash Map Exercise 3 (Group Anagrams)
- [ ] Re-solve Two Sum from scratch using hash map (no peeking!)
- [ ] Solve LeetCode #217 - Contains Duplicate (official problem)
- [ ] Consider setting up GitHub repo

**Notes**:
- First day of the journey! 🚀
- Learned that I need to strengthen fundamentals, not just rush through problems
- Hash maps are CRITICAL - will appear in 40% of problems
- Ready to continue tomorrow with exercises 2 & 3
