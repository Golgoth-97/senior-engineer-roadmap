### 3. Behavioral Interviews
Use STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result)

**Common Questions**:
- Tell me about a challenging project
- Describe a conflict with a team member
- Tell me about a time you failed
- Describe a time you had to learn something quickly

- Tell me about a time you mentored someone
- Describe your most significant technical achievement

### 4. Technical Deep Dive
Be prepared to discuss:
- Past projects in detail
- Architecture decisions and trade-offs
- Technologies you've used
- Challenges you've solved

## STAR Stories Template

Create `behavioral-stories.md` with prepared stories:

```markdown
## Story: [Brief Title]

**Situation**: Context and background

**Task**: What needed to be done

**Action**: What YOU did (focus on your role)

**Result**: Outcome and impact (quantify if possible)

**Skills Demonstrated**: Leadership, problem-solving, etc.
