# Practice Projects

This folder contains code projects that demonstrate senior-level engineering skills.

## Project Ideas by Skill Area

### System Design & Architecture
- Build a URL shortener (caching, scalability, database design)
- Create a rate limiter (algorithms, distributed systems)
- Implement a messaging queue (distributed systems, data structures)
- Design a file sharing service (storage, authentication, scaling)

### Full-Stack Applications
- E-commerce platform (payments, inventory, user management)
- Social media clone (real-time updates, feeds, notifications)
- Project management tool (collaboration, permissions, workflows)
- Content management system (CRUD, versioning, media handling)

### Backend Focus
- REST API with comprehensive testing
- GraphQL API with complex resolvers
- Microservices architecture
- WebSocket-based real-time application
- Background job processing system

### DevOps & Infrastructure
- CI/CD pipeline setup
- Dockerize and orchestrate a multi-service app
- Infrastructure as Code (Terraform/CloudFormation)
- Monitoring and alerting setup

### Algorithms & Data Structures
- Implement common data structures from scratch
- Build algorithm visualizer
- Create a recommendation engine
- Develop a search engine with ranking

## Project Structure

Each project should have:

```
project-name/
├── README.md              # Project overview, setup, learnings
├── docs/
│   ├── ARCHITECTURE.md    # System design and architecture decisions
│   ├── API.md            # API documentation (if applicable)
│   └── DECISIONS.md      # Key technical decisions and trade-offs
├── src/                  # Source code
├── tests/                # Test suite
└── deployment/           # Deployment configs (Docker, k8s, etc.)
```

## Project Template

When starting a new project, document:

1. **Goal**: What you're trying to learn/demonstrate
2. **Tech Stack**: Languages, frameworks, tools
3. **Architecture**: High-level design decisions
4. **Challenges**: Problems faced and solutions
5. **Learnings**: Key takeaways
6. **Future Improvements**: What you'd do differently or add
