# Getting Started

Welcome to your senior software engineer journey! Follow these steps to begin.

## Step 1: Initial Self-Assessment (30 minutes)

Open `02-progress/PROGRESS.md` and:

1. **Rate your current skills** using the emoji system:
   - 🔴 Beginner
   - 🟡 Intermediate
   - 🟢 Proficient
   - 🔵 Advanced
   - ⭐ Expert

2. **Identify your strengths** - What are you already good at?

3. **Identify gaps** - Where do you need the most improvement?

4. **Set your current level** - Are you junior, mid-level, or already approaching senior?

## Step 2: Define Your First Goals (15 minutes)

In the same progress file:

1. **Pick 2-3 technical focus areas** based on your gaps
   - Example: "System design", "Data structures & algorithms", "Cloud platforms"

2. **Pick 1-2 soft skill areas**
   - Example: "Technical writing", "Mentoring"

3. **Set quarterly goals** - What can you realistically achieve in 3 months?
   - Be specific and measurable
   - Example: "Complete 50 LeetCode medium problems" not "Get better at algorithms"

## Step 3: Choose Your First Learning Resource (10 minutes)

Look at `03-learning-resources/RESOURCES.md` and pick:

1. **One book** to start reading
   - Recommendation: "Designing Data-Intensive Applications" for system design
   - Or "Clean Code" for code quality fundamentals

2. **One course or practice platform**
   - LeetCode for algorithms
   - System Design course for architecture

## Step 4: Plan Your First Project (15 minutes)

Look at `04-practice-projects/README.md` and:

1. **Choose a project** that aligns with your learning goals
   - Start simple - don't try to build the next Netflix
   - Example: URL shortener, todo app with authentication, rate limiter

2. **Define the scope**
   - What features will it have?
   - What technologies will you use?
   - What skills will it demonstrate?

## Step 5: Set Up Your Routine (10 minutes)

Create a sustainable learning schedule:

### Daily (if possible)
- 30-60 minutes: LeetCode or algorithm practice
- 30 minutes: Reading or course work

### Weekly
- 2-3 hours: Work on practice project
- 1 hour: Code review of open source projects or study well-architected code
- 30 minutes: Write a reflection on what you learned

### Monthly
- Update progress tracker
- Review and adjust goals
- Complete monthly reflection

## Step 6: Your First Week Plan

Here's a suggested plan for your first week:

### Monday
- Complete initial self-assessment
- Set quarterly goals
- Choose first book/course

### Tuesday-Thursday
- Start LeetCode practice (1-2 easy problems per day)
- Read first chapter of chosen book
- Research your first practice project

### Friday
- Solve 1 medium LeetCode problem
- Create project plan for your practice project
- Set up project repository

### Weekend
- Start building your practice project
- Continue reading
- Write your first weekly reflection

## Quick Wins to Build Momentum

Start with these achievable goals:

- [ ] Solve 10 easy LeetCode problems
- [ ] Read 1 chapter of a technical book
- [ ] Set up a practice project repository
- [ ] Write your first reflection
- [ ] Optimize your LinkedIn profile
- [ ] Update your resume
- [ ] Follow 5 engineering blogs

## Mindset Tips

1. **Consistency over intensity** - 30 minutes daily beats 5 hours on Sunday
2. **Learn by building** - Don't just read, apply the knowledge
3. **Document everything** - Your future self will thank you
4. **Don't compare** - Your journey is unique
5. **Celebrate small wins** - Progress is progress
6. **Ask for help** - Join communities, find mentors
7. **It's a marathon** - Becoming a senior engineer takes time

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- ❌ Tutorial hell - watching courses without building
- ❌ Jumping around - stick with one resource/project at a time
- ❌ Only doing LeetCode - you need real projects too
- ❌ Ignoring soft skills - they're crucial for senior roles
- ❌ Not tracking progress - you'll lose motivation
- ❌ Perfectionism - done is better than perfect
- ❌ Burning out - take breaks, rest is important

## Next Steps

After your first month:

1. Review your progress
2. Adjust your goals based on what worked
3. Deepen focus on weak areas
4. Start thinking about interview preparation
5. Consider contributing to open source
6. Maybe start a technical blog

## Questions to Reflect On

Ask yourself regularly:

- What did I learn this week?
- What challenged me?
- What do I want to learn next?
- Am I moving toward my goals?
- Do my goals need adjustment?
- Am I enjoying the process?
