# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Purpose

This is a personal development repository tracking the journey to becoming a senior software engineer. It contains roadmaps, progress tracking, learning resources, and practice projects.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized to track:
- **Roadmap**: Skills, technologies, and competencies required for senior engineering roles
- **Progress tracking**: Current status, completed milestones, and goals
- **Learning resources**: Articles, courses, books, and documentation references
- **Practice projects**: Code samples and projects demonstrating learned skills
- **Reflections**: Notes on learning experiences and growth areas

## Working with This Repository

When assisting with this repository:

1. **Roadmap updates**: Help create detailed, realistic skill progression paths broken down by:
   - Technical skills (languages, frameworks, tools, architecture patterns)
   - Soft skills (leadership, communication, mentoring)
   - System design and architecture knowledge
   - Best practices and engineering principles

2. **Progress tracking**: Maintain clear, measurable milestones and completion criteria

3. **Resource curation**: Suggest high-quality learning materials relevant to specific skills or gaps

4. **Project guidance**: Help design practice projects that demonstrate senior-level competencies

5. **Reflection support**: Assist in documenting learnings, challenges overcome, and areas for improvement

## File Organization Conventions

- Use markdown for documentation and tracking files
- Keep roadmaps structured and hierarchical
- Date progress entries for historical tracking
- Organize resources by topic/skill area
- Keep project code separate from documentation
