## Tips for Success

### Stay Consistent
- **1 hour every day > 7 hours on Sunday**
- Set a specific time each day for learning
- Use a habit tracker

### Don't Get Discouraged
- Medium LeetCode problems are HARD at first - this is normal
- You'll fail to solve many problems - that's how you learn
- System design feels overwhelming - start simple

### Focus on Understanding, Not Speed
- Better to deeply understand 40 problems than rush through 100
- Take time to understand WHY solutions work
- Implement multiple approaches when possible

### Document Everything
- Write weekly reflections
- Note patterns in LeetCode problems
- Document design decisions in your project

### Ask for Help
- Use LeetCode discussions after attempting problems
- Ask in Reddit/Discord communities
- Read others' code on GitHub

### Celebrate Wins
- First deployed project is HUGE
- Every LeetCode problem solved is progress
- Learning Docker, AWS, design patterns - all valuable

## What's Next? (Month 2 Preview)

After this strong foundation, Month 2 will focus on:
- More Medium LeetCode problems (target: 20 more)
- Second practice project: Real-time Chat Application
- Deeper system design study (Twitter, Instagram designs)
- Learning Kubernetes basics
- Advanced TypeScript patterns
- More design patterns

## Quick Reference: Weekly Time Breakdown

**Weekdays**: 5-7.5 hours total
- 30-45 min/day on LeetCode (2.5-3.75 hours/week)
- 30-45 min/day on other learning (2.5-3.75 hours/week)

**Weekends**: 3-4 hours total

## Checkpoint: Are You on Track?

At the end of each week, ask yourself:

✅ Did I do LeetCode at least 5 days this week?
✅ Did I make progress on my learning goals?
✅ Did I work on my practice project?
✅ Did I document my learning?
✅ Am I enjoying the process (at least somewhat)?

If you answered yes to most - you're doing great!
If not - adjust and keep going. Progress > Perfection.
